# YOLO11 Floor Boundary Detection for Robot Navigation

## Overview
This repository contains a trained YOLOv5 model designed to detect floor boundaries in a given environment. The goal is to assist robotic navigation by identifying the ground boundaries, allowing for effective obstacle avoidance and path planning.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Detects bounding boxes for floor boundaries using the YOLO11 architecture.
- **Training Pipeline**: Included script for training the YOLO11 model on custom datasets.
- **Inference**: Scripts to run inference on images or video feeds  and camera feeds to visualize detected floor boundaries.
